This dashboard uses data from a data set titled "Estimated number of homeless people in the United States from 2007 to 2020". This set is by HUD (United States Department of Housing and Urban Development) and it was published in March 2021. In this assignment I was assigned the task of designing a data dashboard. In this data dashboard it portrays the overall population of the homeless. In addition, to the overall homeless for males, females, transgenders, and the non-conforming. 

The first two items include overall homeless population and a overall homeless population for each state by CoCs. A CoC is Continuum of Care Program. As described by the HUD the CoC is "designed to promote community wide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness..." (HUD).The next visual is for visual the overall homeless population for gender. Finally the last two visuals are data tables for a more close look at the data. 

Instructions for running:

- Download the code into your own computer.

- Open the code along with the data set. 

- Make a working directory and insert it into the setup code. 

- Run the file.
